- **Update** — `okf` is now a dev-shell command (a `writeShellApplication`
  wrapper in `modules/dev.nix` that resolves the live checkout via git);
  [dev](modules/dev.md) and the [OKF Profile](okf-profile.md) tooling section
  updated to match.

- **Creation** — Bundle created as an OKF v0.1 proof of concept. Seeded with 5
  pattern docs, 6 decision records, 6 playbooks, and 45 scaffolded catalog
  stubs (modules, hosts, packages, sub-flakes). Tooling lives in
  `scripts/okf/` (`scaffold` / `index` / `validate` / `viz`); conventions in
  [okf-profile.md](okf-profile.md).
